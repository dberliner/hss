	\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose}
	The Host Socket Sharing (HSS) subclass is a protocol by which USB devices can efficiently manage and use Berkeley/POSIX-style sockets on the host.\\
	\\
	The specification currently defines support for the INET (IPv4) and INET6 (IPv6) protocol families and the TCP and UDP protocols. Future versions may add support for additional families and protocols.\\
	\\
	This protocol offers an alternative method for a device to communicate with remote servers. Existing approaches that operate at the L3 layer (IP/USB) or L2 layer (CDC ECM, EEM, NCM) have several disadvantages.  In particular, they require the device to be assigned an IP address.  Since many networks will assign only a single IP address to a host, this requires implementing some form of network address translation (NAT) on the host.  Setting up the NAT requires userspace configuration in most operating systems, so the USB device is no longer truly plug and play.
	\subsection{Scope}
	This document specifies new device subclasses intended for use with Communication devices,
	based on the Universal Serial Bus Class Definitions for Communication Devices specification
	[USBCDC]. \\
	\\
	The intention of this specification is that all material presented here be upwards-compatible
	extensions of the [USBCDC] specification. New numeric codes are defined for subclass codes,
	protocol codes, management elements, and notification elements. \\
	\\
	In some cases material from [USBCDC] is repeated for clarity. In such cases, [USBCDC] shall be
	treated as the controlling document. \\
	\\
	In this specification, the word ‘shall’ or ‘must’ is used for mandatory requirements, the word
	‘should’ is used to express recommendations and the word ‘may’ is used for options. 
	\section{Overview}
	Host Socket Sharing (HSS) is a specification for efficient management of sockets on a host by its devices. HSS sends Application Layer traffic and internal socket management commands from the device to the host over USB. This module requires host implementations for each supported Network and Transport layer protocols, but other layers are beyond its scope.
	\subsection{What is Host Socket Sharing (HSS)?}
	HSS allows a USB connected device to remotely create and control sockets on its host. A device may only control sockets it has created, and it shall expect exclusive control over this socket. Devices cannot control sockets created by other devices on the same host, and the host will not expose a devices socket for use by other applications.\\
	\\
	Prior to HSS, connected devices would have to be assigned an IP address requiring the host to bridge the device or use NAT which also requires userspace configurations to the host. HSS allows a host to act on behalf of its device and provide it's network connection in a truly plug and play manner. This implicitly subjects the device to the same firewall rules and external network considerations without specific configuration.\\
	\\
	The below figure illustrates a possible use case where a new socket type (Sock 1) is created on the device to interface with HSS. This allows userspace applications to interact with a standard protocol. 
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
			\caption[HSS Overview]{HSS Overview.}
			\scalebox{0.9}{\input{HSSDepiction.tex}}
		\end{center}
	\end{figure}

	\subsection{USB Endpoints}
	HSS's endpoint requirements consist of a bulk pair (In and Out) and command pair (In and Out). 
	The HSS Device Class uses the standard Endpoint descriptor, as defined in chapter 9 of the USB
	Specification. \\
	Additionally, HSS requires a pair of bulk-in/bulk-out endpoints and a control-in endpoint for receiving commands.
	\section{Host Socket Sharing (HSS)}
	The payload of the USB packet contains any combination of a single HSS packet, 
	two or more HSS packets or a split HSS packet. HSS transfers can be split across USB packets but shall not be split across USB transfers. 
	\subsection{HSS Packet Format}
	The packet format defines an HSS packet. For information regarding USB packets refer to [USB2.0] specification. Details packets formats can be found in section 8.4 of the [USB2.0] specification. \\
	\\
	All HSS packets begin with a one-byte opcode (see Table~\ref{tab:table1}), a one-byte message ID and a one-byte Socket ID. \\
	\\
	While represented differently, both types of HSS packets will indicate the length of data being sent and then the data being sent. A packets data segment will always immediately proceed the header and this packet will always be sent in one USB transfer (although USB may split the HSS packet into many USB packets). \\

			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	\end{table} \mbox{}\\
	\subsection{HSS Packet Types}
	HSS has two different types of commands: Command and Payload. Command supports quickly sending short messages and Payload supports sending large messages.
	\subsubsection{Common Fields}
	All HSS packets begin with the following three bytes:\\
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Opcode}: 8-bit unsigned integer identifying what type of packet follows. All Op Codes are defined as either a Command or Data type so this field is sufficient to decide which type of structure to expect.
		\item \textbf{Message ID}: 8-bit unsigned integer provided to allow the receiver to identify the received message when replying. This is always generated by the sender, and the receiver may only reply using the given ID once. Sending an ACK or REPLY to an unknown Message ID causes undefined behavior.
		\item \textbf{bSockID}: 8-bit unsigned integer identifying which sock is being sent to. Sock IDs are always created by the host during an OPEN command.
	\end{enumerate}
	While represented differently, both packets also include a length parameter indicating how much data follows the header. Both length fields are the length of the payload, not including the header. 
	
	\subsubsection{Op Codes}
	\begin{table}[h!]
		\begin{center}
			\caption{OP Codes}
			\label{tab:table1}
			\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|l} 
				\rowcolor{lightgray}
				\textbf{Opcode} &	\textbf{Name} &	\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Purpose}\\
				\hline
				0x00 & OPEN & Cmd & Open a socket on the host\\
				0x01 & CONNECT & Cmd & Connect an open socket to a given address\\
				0x02 & SHUTDOWN & Cmd & Indicates that the sender will not send any more traffic.\\
				0x03 & TRANSMIT & Data & Write data to a connected socket\\
				0x04 & ACK	& Cmd & Acknowledge a command and indicate success\\
				0x05 & ACKDATA	& Data & Similar to ACK but contains data. \\
				0x06 & CLOSE	& Cmd & Close the socket. \\
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}

	\subsubsection{Command}
	HSS Command operations relate to opening, closing and managing sockets across USB. These requests are infrequent and short in length so they do not need to be mixed with larger data transmissions that can take a long time to process. Command packets are always sent over the USB Control EP and have a maximum length of 64 bytes including the header.\\

	\end{bytefield}\\ 
	\subsubsection{Data}
	HSS Data packets are meant for forwarding data across USB bulk endpoints. These requests can contain large amounts of data. These requests are either for sending data transmitted across sockets or acknowledging messages with a response longer than 52 bytes.\\

	\subsection{HSS Packet Ordering}
	Synchronization must be maintained to ensure that all commands arrive at the destination in the order they were requested. In particular, CLOSE commands shall not be transmitted while there is still unsent data and more data shall not be queued to transmit while a CLOSE is waiting to be sent. 
	
	\subsection{Multiple Devices and Separation}
	A host may provide sockets to many devices, but a device may never manage a socket which is controlled by another device. It is the responsibility of the host to ensure packets from one device are never executed on sockets belonging to another.
	
	\section{Packet Processing}
	Fig A describes the process for the receiver on both ends to assemble and transmit packets from USB to their respective proxies. The \colorbox{lightgray}{\lstinline{Send Command To Proxy}} procedure can be assumed to be non-blocking, after which the data passed in can be safely freed. \\
	\\	
	\subsection{Processing Flow}
	\subsubsection{Receiving HSS Packets From USB}
	HSS transmission packets are sent over USB bulk transfers. HSS transfers may not be split over multiple bulk transfers, but may be split over USB Bulk Packets within a single transfers. Many HSS transmission packets may be sent in one bulk transfer. This means that HSS packet headers may also be split between HSS packets. \\
	\\
	HSS transfers will end with one of a short USB packet, zero-length packet over USB (if supported) or a zero-length HSS transfer. Sending a zero-length USB packet when the receiver is expecting the continuation of a HSS packet causes undefined behavior.

	\subsubsection{Reading Transmitted Data}
	The figure below illustrates how either the host or device should its read functions. Read can only work with data that has already been transmitted, it does not ask for data from its peer because any data that can be sent will be sent as soon as possible.

	\subsubsection{Writing Data}
	The figure below illustrates how either the host or device should its handle socket write calls.

	\end{center}
	\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Command Flow}
Commands involve controlling sockets and sending ACKs for commands. \\
\\
Open and Connect require confirmation from the host before the device can change its behavior. Disconnect and Close take effect regardless of acknowledgment, subsequent writes on a closed channel will return an error.
